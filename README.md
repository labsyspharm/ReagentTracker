# ReagentTracker

ReagentTracker is LSP's custom-built Laboratory Information Management System
(LIMS) which records reagent metadata for small molecule perturbation and tissue
imaging experiments. We have found that it is crucial to record the precise
identities and characteristics of reagents, especially for **antibodies** and
**small molecules**, as subtle differences between nominally similar reagents
can lead to confounding results when comparing and combining multiple
experiments. Our Data Managers register all shipments of small molecule and
antibody reagents in ReagentTracker before making the reagents available for
use. LSP researchers then record the stable unique identifiers assigned
by ReagentTracker in their lab notebooks and electronic data files to accurately
reference the precise reagents and lot numbers used in experiments. These unique
identifiers allow later retrieval of key metdata from ReagentTracker for
analysis, reporting, and publication.
